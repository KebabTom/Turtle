TURTLE

Compile from sources directory with
make clean
make all

run the program with:
./turtle <FILENAME>.txt

to run testing:

./turtle test white
(white box testing)

./turtle test black
(black box testing)

./turtle test sys
(system testing)

./turtle test all
(all testing suites)

There are some example files saved in sources/examples/
I reccomend stars.txt, but I'd advise setting the TURTLE_SPEED #define in display.c to about 500 first
